Modernizing building through 3D Printing


This project is based on digitally creating homes and buildings through 3D Printing.
The project aims to :

1) Reduce the total cost of building homes and complex buildings such as workplaces ,i.e., Cost Efficient
2) Reduce the overall time in building ,i.e., Time Efficient
3) We will be providing user to design the infrastructure of his/her choice accompanied by the hire a designer version as well
4) After the initial stages , the project will look forward to transport a whole building from one place as well

We also look to provide employment in following ways :
1) Huge 3D printers will be controlled by workers , hence workers will get employment
2) Employment of freelancing home decor designers 


So, our platform will be a one stop solution in modernizing way of building and will be helping towards providing employment
